## 👋 Hi! I'm Okanlawon Micheal Olatunji, but  you can call me Ejanla


I’m a machine learning practitioner with a strong interest in how machines learn patterns from data. I enjoy building predictive models, exploring datasets, and creating visual insights that turn raw data into clear, useful conclusions.

Growing up in Nigeria, my love for mathematics and critical thinking pushed me toward AI and machine learning. I’m currently working mainly with **Python**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib/Seaborn**, and learning through research and open-source resources.

Right now, I’m focused on improving model performance, strengthening data manipulation skills, and preparing for clustering and pattern discovery.

Skills & Tools
Data Analysis, Predictive Analytics, Data Visualization, AI Fundamentals


## Featured Projects

### 1) Student Academic Performance Prediction (UCI)
- Built and compared **regression** and **classification (A/B/C)** models to predict students’ final grade (**G3**).
- Includes EDA, leakage-aware preprocessing (dropped **G1/G2**), and imbalance-aware evaluation (macro/weighted F1 + confusion matrices).
- Project folder:https://github.com/okanlawon21/MachineLearningProject/tree/master/student-performance-prediction

### 2) Chicago Taxi Fare Prediction (Keras)
- Explored a larger dataset, selected key features, scaled inputs, and trained a simple **Keras regression** model to predict taxi fares.
- Tried different learning rates and compared a one-feature vs two-feature setup to see what improves MAE.
- Notebook:https://github.com/okanlawon21/MachineLearningProject/blob/master/Machine_learning_taxi.ipynb
