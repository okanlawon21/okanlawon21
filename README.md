## Hi! I'm Okanlawon Micheal Olatunji, but  you can call me Ejanla



I am a passionate machine learning student with love for how machines operate studying patterns, and data structures. I enjoy working on building machine learning models and visualization and I solve problems by turning data into insights, manipulations which i enjoy most.

As a kid growing up in Nigeria with vibrant diversity, I like mathematical task because of critical thinking  work which drove my interest into machine learning. I akways have a thing for why and how things work although don't konw why it's just me wanting the laws of the universe.

Currentlly an AI Engineering Student
Building machine learning models and Data Analysis Solutions
I specialize in Python and Predictive Analytics, Scikit-learn, pandas, and Data Visualization
Knowledge gained through Research anf open sources

I'm currently learning to improve model accuracy and performance, mastering Data manipulations and transformation, getting ready for clustering and pattern discovery also improving my ability to create meaningful visual insights with matplotlib.

Skills & Tools
Data Analysis, Predictive Analytics, Data Visualization, AI Fundamentals


## Featured Projects

### 1) Student Academic Performance Prediction (UCI)
- Built and compared **regression** and **classification (A/B/C)** models to predict students’ final grade (**G3**).
- Includes EDA, leakage-aware preprocessing (dropped **G1/G2**), and imbalance-aware evaluation (macro/weighted F1 + confusion matrices).
- Project folder:https://github.com/okanlawon21/MachineLearningProject/tree/master/student-performance-prediction

### 2) Chicago Taxi Fare Prediction (Keras)
- Explored a larger dataset, selected key features, scaled inputs, and trained a simple **Keras regression** model to predict taxi fares.
- Tried different learning rates and compared a one-feature vs two-feature setup to see what improves MAE.
- Notebook:https://github.com/okanlawon21/MachineLearningProject/blob/master/Machine_learning_taxi.ipynb
